    #region Explanation:
    /*________________________________________________________________________________________Explanation_____________________________________________________________________________________________
       🖕 The SetClass() method checks whether the swapToSoloClass and swapToFarmClass flags are both set to true. If so, it logs an error message and returns.
       🖕 The method initializes newSoloClass and newFarmClass variables with the current values of SoloClass and FarmClass, respectively.
       🖕 If both SoloClass and FarmClass are already set and not "Generic", the method logs a message indicating that the CBO classes are already set and exits.
       🖕 If SoloClass is not already set, the method attempts to find a valid class from the soloClassesToCheck list using the CheckAndSetClass() method.
       🖕 If a valid class is found in the soloClassesToCheck list, it is set as newSoloClass, and the method logs a message indicating the class was found.
       🖕 If SoloClass is already set, the method logs a message indicating the predetermined SoloClass is being used.
       🖕 If FarmClass is not already set, the method attempts to find a valid class from the farmClassesToCheck list using the CheckAndSetClass() method.
       🖕 If a valid class is found in the farmClassesToCheck list, it is set as newFarmClass, and the method logs a message indicating the class was found.
       🖕 If FarmClass is already set, the method logs a message indicating the predetermined FarmClass is being used.
       🖕 If the swapToSoloClass flag is true, the method equips the class represented by newSoloClass using Core.EquipClass().
       🖕 If the swapToFarmClass flag is true, the method equips the class represented by newFarmClass using Core.EquipClass().
       🖕 SoloClass and FarmClass are updated with the values of newSoloClass and newFarmClass, respectively.
       🖕 The method logs messages indicating the updated SoloClass and FarmClass values.

       The CheckAndSetClass() method checks if the provided classToCheck is "Generic" or exists in the classesToCheck array.
       If so, it calls the FindValidClass() method to find a valid class from the classesToCheck list and possibly ranks it up.
       If classToCheck is not "Generic" and not found in classesToCheck, the method logs a message indicating the predetermined class is being used.

       The FindValidClass() method iterates through classesToCheck to find a valid class in the player's inventory.
       If a valid class is found, it logs whether the class is being ranked up or not and returns the class name.
       If no valid class is found, it logs a message that no valid class was found and returns "Generic".

       This approach allows the SetClass() method to independently set SoloClass and FarmClass, choose valid classes based on predefined lists,
       and optionally rank up classes, providing flexibility for class management.
